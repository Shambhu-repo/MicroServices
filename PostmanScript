{
"order":{
    "name":"Rohan",
    "qty": 1,
    "price":250.00
},
"payment":{}
}

This is to use two object returninng api : ordercontrolleer is posting TransactionRequest
as a body . And TransactionRequest is having two object as its field : paymentDTO and ORder .
so we we have to pass two object in postmand
