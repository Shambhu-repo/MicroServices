# MicroServices
This is the microservies practice from javaTechhi and have tried to use all the technique to understand:
here we have multiple project:
a. ConfigServer : it will config all the properties file in git which called central config
b.ServieRegistory : This is the Eureka Server 
c. Payment-Servie : this is the microservice
d.order-service or department service is another microservice
e.sampleOfYamlandPropertiesFile is sample of file
